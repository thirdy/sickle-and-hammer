A worklog tool I've been hacking on my lunch time. Makes life easier if you need to log your hours on JIRA.

Sickle and hammer is free and open source tool you can use to submit your worklog faster than usual using the jira web UI.

To setup

Run sickle-and-hammer runnable jar
Enter your jira username and password
Put in your jira hostname e.g. (locahost)
Write your work log/s
Click Do my worklog!
Enjoy
Tips

You can switch dates any time by clicking any date in the calendar
"//" and "--" are treated as line comment
You can use Remember me to save your username and password (note that this uses OS environment storage like System Registry in windows which might not be very secure)
